OpenFoundation Style Guidelines
-------------------------------
Tabs vs. Spaces
	Tabs are the preference, as one can set his editor to visually expand
	them to any length.  Tab in at each logical block.
Brace Placement
	Braces for methods, functions, and instance variable blocks should all
	be on their own lines, opening and closing. Anything deeper than that
	is fair game between that and opening on the block statement and
	closing on its own line.
#import vs. #include
	Use #include for C libraries (as most have header guards to protect
	them) and use #import for Objective-C libraries.  Put #imports before
	#includes.
#imports in implementation files
	For a given implementation file (.m), if it has a corresponding header
	file (.h), only import the header in the implementation, and import
	any other necessary files in the header itself.
